// Package uidfilter is the mechanism half of the "Strict Split Tunneling"
// feature (issue amnezia-client#2457) for the AmneziaWG datapath. It gates
// OUTBOUND packets read from the Android tun device: packets whose owning app
// is disallowed by the split-tunnel policy are dropped before encryption, so an
// app that bypasses the OS split-tunnel rules (via SO_BINDTODEVICE on tun0)
// cannot leak traffic — and the VPN server IP — into the tunnel.
//
// The policy (resolving the owning app UID and applying include/exclude rules)
// lives outside this package and is injected via Set as a PacketFilter — on
// Android it bridges through JNI to ConnectivityManager.getConnectionOwnerUid.
// Because this datapath is packet-based (the filter would otherwise be consulted
// for every packet), a TCP connection is judged on its SYN alone, every SYN
// afresh, and a UDP flow's verdict is cached per 5-tuple for a few seconds, so
// the expensive cross-language call happens about once per new flow.
//
// That call is slow — a binder call with a netlink socket-table walk behind it
// — so it never runs on the goroutine that reads the tun device. A packet of a
// flow not yet judged is copied and held, within limits on packets, bytes and
// time, while a small pool of workers asks the filter; the verdict then sends
// or drops what was held. No packet of a flow leaves before its verdict, and
// flows already judged do not wait for the ones being judged. While too many
// flows wait, packets of new ones are dropped rather than held.
//
// The platform can only name the owner of a socket that still exists. A
// datagram sent from a socket closed right after sending may be judged too
// late, and is then dropped like one of an unknown owner.
//
// While a filter is installed, packets whose owner cannot be resolved are
// dropped: anything but TCP and UDP, IPv4 fragments whose first fragment was
// not seen, and IPv6 packets with extension headers, IPv6 fragments included.
// The later fragments of a datagram follow the verdict on its first one. An unprivileged app can send ICMP echo through a ping
// socket bound to the tun device, and the platform resolves owners for TCP and
// UDP only, so passing such packets would reopen the bypass.
//
// When no filter is installed (the default), Gate.AllowOutboundPacket returns
// true after a single atomic load, and Supported is false off Android, so
// callers can drop the branch at compile time and the legacy path costs nothing.
